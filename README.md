Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine learningModel

A heart attack happens when blood supply to the heart becomes significantly reduced or obstructed.The obstruction is typically caused by a buildup of fat, cholesterol, and other chemicals in thearteries leading to the heart (coronary). Plaques are the name given to these cholesterol- and fatty-rich formations. Atherosclerosis describes the process of plaque accumulation.
A plaque can rupture and generate a clot, which can obstruct blood flow. Part of the heart musclemight become damaged or even die if there is not enough blood flow.
A heart attack is sometimes referred to as a myocardial infarction.
About the Data Set
The offered data includes a table of patient data that includes age, gender, heart rate, systolic bloodpressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood sugar, CK-MB, and troponin values. 100 patients with chestdiscomfort were treated at the hospital and provided with the data. In order to diagnose heart attacks,doctors need the data.
Individual patients are represented by the rows. The information for each patient is listed in the sameorder, from left to right.
The data is an important resource for clinicians since it can aid in the diagnosis and treatment ofheart attacks. The information is also useful in the study of cardiac attacks.
